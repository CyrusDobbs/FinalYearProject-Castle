# FinalYearProject-Castle

See Dissertation_Final.pdf for an in depth overview of my project.

The aim of my project was to develop a game engine for the card game Castle
and an AI player. In order to produce the AI player, I compared and
contrasted different algorithms. Upon finding the most appropriate, I then
developed a working player before further enhancing it using Deep Learning.
After collecting a vast amount of training data, I used Keras to train a Convolutional Neural Network to be used by the AI player to evaluate game
states and make better decisions.
